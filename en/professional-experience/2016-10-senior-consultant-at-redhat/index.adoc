* icon:calendar[] `October 2016 to August 2017`:
** {w2016-10-a}.
** {w2016-10-b}. Some pieces of this project is available in {uri-paulojeronimo-github}[my account on GitHub] with an {uri-jboss-domain-mode-scripts-docs-pt-br}[extensive documentation __(in pt-br)__].
* icon:calendar[] `May 2017 to July 2017`:
** I and {uri-wally}[a colleague] did a migration of several {JavaEE} applications in {Previ} customer ({PreviRioDeJaneiro}).
These migrations were done for applications running on {JBossEAP}.
The main goal was to migrate these apps from {JBossEAP} 6.1 to version 6.4.
To achieve this goal, we did a lot of code refactorings, {Maven} POM and {Jenkins} configurations updates.
Also, we build the all the new environments (from local development to production).
* icon:calendar[] `April 2017 to May 2017`:
** {w2016-10-c}. This was built for {Ancine} customer ({AncineRioDeJaneiro}) (a Brazilian government agency).
In this PoC the objective was importing users (and roles) from an external database (Oracle) to permit authentication and authorization from it, as well from Active Directory (at the same time).
* icon:calendar[] `March 2017`:
** {w2016-10-d}. Unfortunately, I was unsuccessful because many components from this application were very old and need to be upgraded before this migration.
The budget for this project wasn't estimated for this task.
