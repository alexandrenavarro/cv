I was hired to develop commercial systems (Financial Check Poster Control, Telesales, Postal Refund, etc) using as the {Pascal} programming language.

My development programs were built by using with Object Oriented (OO) Pascal.
OO was introduced in Pascal with {TurboPascal55}.
That compiler was my first compiler when <<my-graduation,I was studying Computer Science at the university>>.

I developed several systems at this time, using Pascal until Borland Pascal version 7.0.

It was at this time that I migrated my interests for object orientation in {cpp} and started working with this language.
