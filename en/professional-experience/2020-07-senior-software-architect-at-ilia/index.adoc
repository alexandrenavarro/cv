icon:group[] Working as a Software Architect at {ilia}.

Working at {CaixaSeguradora} focused on creating {RH-SSO} ({Keycloak})
software extensions.
Basically, the things that I created to this project was written in
{Bash} and {Java} and the last extension that I created built an
integration between {Keycloak} and an *Interactive Voice Response* (IVR)
system.

Some non related projects that I created in a open source way only to
study or explore more about some {Keycloak} features that I'm using in
my customizations, are exposed in these links:
