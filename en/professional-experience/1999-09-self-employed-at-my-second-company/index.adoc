*Paulo Jerônimo Treinamentos Eireli-ME* is the current name of my own micro company.
It was founded in September 1999 with the name *ALP Engenharia de Software Ltda*.
For many years my company lived only attending some specify customers, without a trademark.
So, in April 2010, I decided to give it one: *http://ladoservidor.com[Lado Servidor]*.
Using this name, I developed many works involving the creation of custom training to many customers.
Also, I gave solutions and did many services associated with Java application servers.
Another work was the application development (especially in {JavaEE}, on multiple platforms).

I kept the http://blog.ladoservidor.com[Lado Servidor's blog].
This blog is available, now, for historical reasons.
It does not suffer updates anymore.
All the posts created for this blog was written in Brazilian Portuguese (pt-br).
Those posts contain various solutions and tutorials for some technologies, especially those addressing the use of {JavaEE} middleware ({JBossEAP}, {GlassFish}, {IBMWebSphere}, etc).
Some friends (including {MarceloAncelmo} and {BrunoBorges}), also with extensive knowledge in the Java EE world, contributed in adding some posts to __Lado Servidor__ blog.

In April 2014, I decided to not update __Lado Servidor__ blog anymore.
That decision was done to give more emphasis in my own name.
So, I asked my accountant to change the name to the current that I'm using.

Now, through my company, I'm playing the following roles:

* <<_2017-09-java-instructor-at-oracle>>.
* <<_2016-10-senior-consultant-at-redhat>>.
* <<_2014-09-jboss-instructor-at-redhat>>.

Using the trademark __Lado Servidor__ I did:

* icon:calendar[] April 2010 -> April 2014: I developed and ministered courses to many customers.
Details in "<<delivered-courses>>".
* icon:calendar[] April 2010 -> December 2010, at {Cabal}: I worked in the assembly of an infrastructure based on JBoss AS and the migration / transformation of services written in Java for this new infra. The migration also involved the "mavenization" of several projects, with the use of {Maven} 3.0 and {Nexus}, as well as the development of several scripts ({Bash}/ {Python}) for the automation of tasks related to the deployment of components in different environments (from development to prodution).

I developed the monitoring solution for the network servers by EFL (lottery financial station).
