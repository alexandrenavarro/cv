icon:calendar[] `September 1999 to January 2018` - Self-employed at Paulo Jerônimo ME::
*Paulo Jerônimo Treinamentos Eireli-ME* was the name of my own micro
company.
It was founded in September 1999 with the name *ALP Engenharia de
Software Ltda*.
For many years my company lived only attending some specify customers,
without a trademark.
Therefore, in April 2010, I decided to give it one:
*{uri-ladoservidor}[Lado Servidor]*.
Using this name, I developed many works involving the creation of custom
training to many customers.
