I did {uri-cv}/#conferences-and-presentations[a lot of presential talks]
about many technical topics in Brazil.
Currently I'm redirecting my efforts to produce online content on
{uri-paulojeronimo-youtube}[my YouTube Channel].

This is a very reduced list with some of the most relevant conferences
that I already did a talk in Brazil:

* JUDCon Brazil, {SaoPaulo}, 2014 September 26.
* Oracle Technology Developer Day (OTN Day), {SaoPaulo}, 2011 August 02.
* JustJava, {SaoPaulo}, 2011 May 18.
