{Tecnisys} is a {RedHat}'s partner. When I was working there, also, an {IBM} partner.

I worked for this employer offering consulting and training services on Red Hat's Linux, middleware and cloud products, including the following servers / solutions: {OpenStack}, {OpenShift}, {JBossEAP}, {WildFly}, {JBossESB}, {JBossFuse}, {JBossDataVirtualization}, {JBossAMQ}, {JBossDeveloperStudio}, {JBossBPMSuite}, {JBossBRMS}.

I also did some works related to IBM products: {IBMWorklight}.

To their customers, I recommended, specified and developed scalable architectures using these products.

I helped the sales team, acting as a pre-salesman (technical) when necessary.

Some tasks completed on customers:

* {Celepar} {CeleparCuritiba}:
** I wrote a PoC to show how to use the native management interface for Wildfly via a Java program.
This PoC has published in the <<wildfly-native-management-api-sample>> GitHub repository.
* {STN} {STNBrasilia}:
** I was responsible to integrate {JBossFuse} with {Keycloak}.
This solution was published in the <<gerador-jboss-bpmsuite-keycloak>> GitHub repository.
** I taught the customer team about how to use the {Arquillian} and {Forge} development tools.
I did it, in a course, when I wrote the publication <<javaee-tutorial-testes,"Java EE application tests with Arquillian">>.
